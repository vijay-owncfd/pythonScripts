This utility converts edge meshes in .dat format to .obj format
.obj can be used in snappyHexMesh and also can be opened in paraview

**Usage:**
- There are two .dat files in the sampleDATfiles folder.

- Run the following command
`python3 edge_mesh_dat_to_obj_converter.py sampleDATfiles/edge_1.dat sampleDATfiles/edge_2.dat`

- This will result in creation of two .obj files with the same name as the .dat files in the sampleDATfiles folder
